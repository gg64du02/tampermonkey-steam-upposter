# tampermonkey-steam-upposter

## What is it:

This is suppose to send a "up" message in a specific thread set in the script.

## How to use it:

1. install TamperMonkey on Chrome

2. install the script in TM

3. set the steam thread URL inside the script "stream_thread_to_up", "hours_timer_for_upposting"
 and "time_in_min_for_refresh"

4. put the website as home url for Chrome (or one of the defaults url)

5. enjoy

Every time the page is refreshed the script will check if it can up post onto the thread

(with the minimal set in hours_timer).

## Why:

I can't always think to up post.
