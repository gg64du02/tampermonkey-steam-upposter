# tampermonkey-steam-upposter

## What is it:

This is suppose to send a "up" message in a specific thread set in the script.

## How to use it:

1. install TamperMonkey on Chrome

2. install the script in TM

3. set the steam thread URL inside the script "stream_thread_to_up"

4. put the website in English in order to work

5. put the website as home url for Chrome (or one of the defaults url)

6. enjoy

Every day the script will post a up post onto the thread:

the script will check if there is something to send or not every time

you will open the thread (and if the script is enabled)

## Why:

I can't always think to up post.
